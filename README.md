# timeseries.js
This small project aims to display any absolute events and time series in an interactive and very manageable way. In each selected scale, one should be able to classify the absolute time frame at a glance. In the same display, it should be able to serve as a calendar as well as display time series such as temperature curves. Try the [demo](https://hgruber.github.io/timeseries.js/index.html) to experience the intuitive dragging and zooming.
